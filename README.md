Official PyTorch implementation for our works on the topic of **efficiently adapting the pre-trained Vision Foundational Models (VFM) on 3D Medical Image Segmentation task**.

## 🔥🔥🔥 Contributions
We foucs on proposing more advanced adapters or training algorithms to adapt the pre-trained VFM (both natural and medical-specific models) on 3d medical image segmentation.

🔥 ***Data-Efficient***: Use less data to achieve more competitive performance 

🔥 ***Parameter-Efficient***: Enhance the representation by lightweight adapters, such as local-feature, global-feature or other existing adapters.
