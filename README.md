Official PyTorch implementation for our works on the topic of **efficiently adapting the pre-trained Vision Foundational Models (VFM) on 3D Medical Image Segmentation task**.

[1] ["Tri-Plane Mamba: Efficiently Adapting Segment Anything Model for 3D Medical Images"](https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2024/paper/2184_paper.pdf) ([MICCAI 2024](https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2024))

## 🌊🌊🌊 News

💧 ***[2024-10-22]*** Re-organize and Upload partial core codes.

## 🔥🔥🔥 Contributions
We foucs on proposing more advanced adapters or training algorithms to adapt the pre-trained VFM (both ***natural*** and ***medical-specific*** models) on 3d medical image segmentation.

🔥 ***Data-Efficient***: Use less data to achieve more competitive performance, such as semi-supervised, few-shot, zero-shot, and so on.

🔥 ***Parameter-Efficient***: Enhance the representation by lightweight adapters, such as local-feature, global-feature, or other existing adapters.
